# Animated Charts

Using the Animated Charts MVP, users have the option to stop using boring stable charts for their presentations and use a new, interactive way of presenting their data to stakeholders. In a collaboration with a UX Designer, we have created a roadmap for the project that includes features like export, custom graph styles, own branding or live data (stock, sport scores).
